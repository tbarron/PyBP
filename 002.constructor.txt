=== #2 When the constructor finishes, the object should be complete and well-formed  link:PyBP.html#ref_1[<1>]


**Why**: If two operations are not tied together by the code but I have to
remember to followup A with B, sooner or later I'm going to forget B. 

==== Example

**Poor**: 

(Object is not complete when constructor finishes running)

----
    import Human
    p = Human.Person()
    p.name = "George"
    p.age = 75
    p.married = True 
----

**Better**:

----
    import Human
    p = Human.Person(name="George", age=75, married=True)
    # when the constructor completes, all of the members of p are set
----
