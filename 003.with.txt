=== #3 Use +with+ to represent pairs of action that should be taken together.  footnoteref:[note_1]

**Why**: It's easy to forget the downstream action, especially if
there's enough code using the resource to distract you.

**How**: Use Python's +with+ statement when accessing the resource so
that disposition of the resource is automatic.

==== Example

**Not so good**:

----
    f = open(filename, 'w')
    f.write(data)
    ...                         <1>
    f.close()                   <2>
----
 <1> Imagine 100 lines of output here.
 <2> Wouldn't it be easy to forget this close?

**Better**:

----
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(data)           <3>
----
 <3> The close is automatic. You don't have to remember.
