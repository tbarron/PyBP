=== #3 Use with to represent pairs of action that should be taken together.  link:PyBP.html#ref_1[<1>]

**Why**: It's easy to forget the downstream action, especially if
  there's enough code using the resource to distract you.

==== Example

**Not so good**:

----
    f = open(filename, 'w')
    f.write(data)
    f.close()
----

**Better**:

----
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(data)
----
