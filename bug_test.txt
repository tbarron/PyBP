'''
== Find a Bug, Write a Test

You just found a bug in your code. What's the first thing you do?

I think most us of start looking at the code trying to figure out
where the problem is and what to do about it. I know that's my
instinctive first response.

I'd like to suggest that a better first step is to write a test that
demonstrates the presence of the bug by tickling it and failing. Then,
when we remove the bug, our new test will start working. And we'll
have a more complete, more robust test suite.

**Why**: Capturing knowledge about past bugs in tests allows us to
  code with confidence, knowing that any regressions will be exposed
  the next time we run our tests. (Well, "knowing" may be a little
  strong. But you get the idea.)

**How**: !@!
