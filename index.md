title: Python Best Practices
---

# Introduction

The goal of this book is to document a set of best practices that make
sense to me for coding in Python. In formulating these practices, my goal
has been to produce software that just works, is easy to maintain, and is
easy to change.

The focus is on Python because that’s the language I use every day, that
I’m most familiar with. I'm hopeful that many of the ideas will apply to
other languages as well.

These ideas are rules of thumb that work pretty well most of the time. They
will not be applicable in every case. In reading and applying these ideas,
think about your specific circumstance and whether a given practice makes
sense or not.
