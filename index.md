### Introduction

The goal of this book is to document the practices that seem to work best
for me when coding in Python. In formulating these practices, my goal has
been to produce software that just works and is easy to maintain and
change.

I use Python, so that's the language I write about.

These ideas are rules of thumb that seem to work pretty well for me most of
the time. I'd be interested to hear if you find them helpful.
