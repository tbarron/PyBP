General Practices
===========================

Use Python 3
---------------------------

Avoid Python 2! If you *are* still using Python 2, do whatever it takes to
get to Python 3. For goodness' sake, don't start any new projects based on
Python 2.x.

According to PEP_373_, Python 2.7 will not be maintained beyond 2020.
Pythonclock.org_ shows a countdown to April 12, 2020, the anticipated date
of PyCon that year and proposes a party there to celebrate Python 2's
contribution to human well-being.

The clock is ticking and 2020 will be here before you know it. You have been
warned.
