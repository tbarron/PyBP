Preface
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These are some best practices I've stolen from colleagues and formulated
for myself over the course of a decade of learning and using Python. Some
of them are opinionated. I hope you will find them as useful and effective
as I have.

Standard Disclaimers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These ideas are rules of thumb that work pretty well for me most of the
time. They will not be applicable in every case. As in most areas of life,
common sense and good judgement are required. Of course, good judgement
comes with experience and a lot of that comes from poor judgement.

In considering these ideas, I hope the reader will reflect on the pros and
cons of each practice, apply the ones that seem useful, and ignore those
that don't.

- Your mileage may vary.

- Every statement is a hypothesis, subject to being debunked by future
  information.

- Lord willing and the creek don't rise.

- Unless we get a better offer.

- Until circumstance intervene.

- Every statement of intention is a current plan that may or may not be
  realized.

- Last time I looked.

- If present trends continue.

- Past results are no guarantee of future performance.

- No plan survives contact with reality.

- This is not an exhaustive list.


I hope you'll find these ideas useful.
