Define Internal Conventions
------------------------------------------------------------

To keep your program sane, you need to make rules for yourself and
apply them consistently. This collection of best practices is a set of
suggested rules for creating sane software that works, however, each
program needs to have its own internal consistency and integrity,
especially as it grows.

**Why**:

- If your program grows beyond a single file of a few hundred lines, you'll
  find that it becomes more and more difficult to keep the details
  straight. Internal, program-specific conventions will help you keep your
  code consistent and functional.

**How**:

- Make the internal conventions for each program explicit by writing them
  as comments in the code itself.
