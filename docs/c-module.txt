Module Docstrings
------------------------------------------------------------

For each module that you write, provide a docstring describing the
purpose it serves in the overall context of the program.

**Why**:

* The ``pydoc`` command will use the docstring as part of your
  program's documentation.

**How**:

* Put a pair of triple quotes at the top of the file
  with the docstring between them

* Double quotes and single quotes both work as far as Python is concerned.
  Some editors may prefer one or the other. For example, emacs seems to 
  work better with double quotes for docstrings.


**Example**:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*No docstring -- Poor*::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    class Foobar(...):
        ...

No description of the module appears in the pydoc output.

*Obvious docstring -- Better than nothing (maybe)*::

    """                                           <1>
    This module describes module docstrings
    """

 <1> Triple quotes delimit the docstring.

The description becomes part of the program documentation. However, an
obvious docstring that doesn't answer questions about the purpose of the
module is not helpful. One that gets out of synch with the content of the
module can be worse than nothing because it is misleading.

*Places this module in the big picture -- Better*::

    """                                           <1>
    This discussion of module docstrings in Python is one of a group of
    Python Best Practices.
    """

 <1> Triple quotes delimit the docstring.

The description becomes part of the program documentation.
