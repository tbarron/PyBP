Object Completeness
------------------------------------------------------------

When the constructor finishes, the object should be complete and well-formed.

**Why**::

* If two operations are not tied together by the code but I have to
remember to followup A with B, sooner or later I'm going to forget B. 

**How**::

* Just make sure that at the end of +{ul}init(){ul}+, all the
attributes of the object have been set to a valid value.

Better yet, write a test for each of your object constructors that verifies
a newly constructed object has a valid, meaningful value for each of its
attributes.

**Instead of this**::

    import Human
    p = Human.Person()                                    <1>
    p.name = "George"
    p.age = 75
    p.married = True

 <1> The constructor has finished at this point, but the person has no
 name, age, or marital status.

**Do this**::

    import Human
    p = Human.Person(name="George", age=75, married=True) <2>

 <2> When the constructor completes, all of the members of p are set.
