Bare Raises
------------------------------------------------------------

By "bare" raise, we mean a ``raise`` with no arguments. This typically
occurs when an exception has been caught and the decision is to send it on
up the call stack rather than handling it in the current location.

A bare ``raise`` statement usually indicates you're doing something
unnecessary. Generally, if you want the exception to propagate up the
stack, you should not be catching it in the first place.

If you can handle some but not all exceptions at a given level, just catch
the ones you can handle and don't mention the ones that should bubble up.

**Why**:

* Bare ``raise`` statements are usually not needed.

**How**: 

* Only specify the exceptions the current level knows how to handle. Others
  should be allowed to percolate up the stack to a higher level handler.

**Example**:

*Instead of this*::

    function load_data_file(path):
        """
        Read and parse a data file, returning a structure
        """
        try:
            with open(path, 'r') as input:
                data = parse(input.read())
                return data

        except Exception as err:
            if err.__class__ == ValueError:
                raise # handled at a higher level
            if err.__class__ == FileNotFoundError:
                sys.exit("{} does not exist".format(path))
            if err.__class__ == PermissionError:
                sys.exit("Cannot open {} for read".format(path))


*Do this*::

    function load_data_file(path):
        """
        Read and parse a data file, returning a structure
        """
        try:
            with open(path, 'r') as input:
                data = parse(input.read())
                return data

        except FileNotFoundError:
            sys.exit("{} does not exist".format(path))

        except PermissionError:
            sys.exit("Cannot open {} for read".format(path))

    # ValueErrors will bubble up to be handled at a higher level
