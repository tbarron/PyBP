Build Layers of Code, Like a Cake
------------------------------------------------------------

Functions at a lower level of your layer cake should never call functions
in higher levels.

**Why**:

* Upward calls (functions in a lower level calling functions in a higher
  level) are likely to create unresolvable cycles of dependency among the
  components of your project.

**How**:

* Define and document the layers of software your project requires and
  ensure that functions never call above their own layer.

In general, to avoid dependency cycles, make sure all the calls a function
issues are to functions in the same layer or lower.

An implication of this is that nitty gritty work should be done in lower
layers of the cake with higher layers recruiting functions in lower
layers to accomplish more comprehensive goals.

For example, if we are parsing text, we might have a function in the lowest
level that reads bytes from a file. In the next layer up is a function that
consumes the bytes from the file and assembles them into words. Yet another
layer up is code that consumes the words to count the frequency of specific
words or grammatical constructions.
