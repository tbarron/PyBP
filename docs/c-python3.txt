Use Python 3
---------------------------

Use Python 3. If you *are* still using Python 2, do whatever it takes to
get to Python 3. For goodness sake, don't start any new projects based on
Python 2.x.

**Why**:

* According to PEP_373_, Python 2.7 will not be maintained beyond 2020.
  Pythonclock.org_ shows a countdown to April 12, 2020, the anticipated
  date of PyCon that year and proposes a party there to celebrate Python
  2's contribution to human well-being.

  The clock is ticking and 2020 will be here before you know it. You have
  been warned.

**How**:

* Use the 2to3_ tool. Its page contains a list of the fixers the 2to3 tool
  runs.

* When you do have to write Python 2 for whatever reason, make your code as
  friendly as possible to the version 3 interpreter. For example, use
  parentheses on 'print' statements, even though version 2 doesn't require
  it.
