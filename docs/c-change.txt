Instead of Predicting the Future, Respond to Change 
------------------------------------------------------------

Yogi Berra has been quoted as having said, "It's really hard to make
predictions, especially about the future." This is nowhere more true
than in software engineering. An approach that calls for capturing
requirements and documenting a ginormous design followed by six months
of coding implicitly assumes that at the beginning of the project we
can predict what will be needed from the software we're writing at the
end of the project, possibly years later.

Instead of predicting the future badly, focus on responding to change as it
happens.

**Why**:

 - "It's really hard to make predictions, especially about the future."

**How**:

  * In a 2014 anti-Agile_ screed on his blog_, Dave Thomas outlines the
    following process model:

    1. Find out where you are
    2. Take a small step towards your goal
    3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
    4. Repeat

As a general guideline, he offers, "When faced with two or more
alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes
future change easier." [#thomas]_
