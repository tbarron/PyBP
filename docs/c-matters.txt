Test What Matters
------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure your tests are testing what matters. It's often easier to write
do-nothing tests that give the appearance of testing without actually
verifying the behavior of the target code.

**Why**:

* Tests that don't validate what you expect your code to be doing and flush
  out bugs are not helpful. The whole point of testing is to help you
  develop confidence that your code is behaving as expected.

**How**:

* Analyze your code to identify the critical aspects of its behavior and
  modularize to facilitate testing those. If necessary, rewrite the target
  code to facilitate testing it.

Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Instead of this**::

    def test_app_function():
        result = app_function()
        # pass if we got anything
        assert result != ""


**Do this**::

    def test_app_function():
        result = app_function()
        # check for expected content
        assert 'expected string' in result
        # check that unexpected content is not present
        assert 'Traceback' not in result
