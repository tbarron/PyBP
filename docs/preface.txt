Preface
-------------------

These are some best practices I've stolen from colleagues and formulated
for myself over the course of a decade of learning and using Python. I hope
the fact that it's mildly opinionated is justified by the effectiveness of
the practices in making code easier to maintain and change.

I hope you'll find this material useful.
