You Aren't Gonna Need It
------------------------------------------------------------

When considering how to solve a problem, ask yourself, "What is the
simplest thing I could do that might possibly work?" Whatever the answer
is, try it, at least as a first approximation to the solution. You *may*
have to revisit and improve it, but you may not.

Don't add stuff you might need in the future. When you need it, add it,
but not before. By waiting, you will often avoid working on code that would
never actually get used.

**Why**:

- Most of the time, when I have spent time putting in features "just in
  case", I wound up not needing them. In effect, that time was wasted.

**How**:

- Focus on what your software needs to do right now and make it do just
  that as well as possible. Avoiding scope and feature creep will leave you
  more time to get the required features right as simply as possible.
