== Convention over Configuration

You _can_ set up a Python project any way you want. You may even be
able to tweak environment variables and write infrastructure support
code until something actually works. But it will be a lot easier if
you learn and use the conventions of the Python infrastructure that's
already provided.

**Why**: Because if we keep reinventing the wheel, we'll never get to
  Denver.

**How**: Learn how to layout a python project, use setup.py, distutil,
  inspect, etc. Here are some good places to start:

* https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/introduction.html
* https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python_boilerplate_template
