I want to set this up to be housed at tbarron.github.io/PyBP, or something
like that, similar to tbarron.github.io. It will be written in Markdown.



Decisions

 - No four space indent at beginning of line is necessary in example
   code blocks

Questions

 - How do I make +__init__()+ be rendered without the __ being
   translated to <em> by asciidoc? I just want it in the monospace
   font.
